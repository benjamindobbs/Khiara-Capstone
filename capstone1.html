        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In a world where you, your family members, and your friends can be shot to death in the street— in school, at work, in your home— it’s a wonder that gun laws aren’t stricter by now. In fact, with gun violence rates rising steadily by the day, it makes one wonder why gun laws are getting looser with those rates. The Second Amendment protects one’s right to bear arms, but it has long been argued that laws protecting guns should be eradicated for the hope of a safer country. Regarding gun laws in the US, politicians follow the will of the NRA rather than the people, gun control laws should not be based on political party in office that the time, the Constitution needs to be changed, and the sale of assault weapons contributes to domestic violence, suicide rates, and disproportionately affects minority groups.</p>

        <h3>1.</h3>
        <p>Research has found that there is evidence of politicians following the will of pro-gun organizations, especially the NRA (National Rifle Association). Statistics taken from Brady United, an anti-gun organization, show that 97% of U.S. citizens want expanded background checks regardless of political affiliation, race, gender, etc.. Additionally, anti-gun organizations such as March For Our Lives or Sandy Hook Promise have a vast number of supporters and protests have been made for a long time now. Yet gun laws continue to loosen by the day. Certain politicians are also found to accept money from the NRA, the top five politicians accepting the most money being Mitt Romney, a junior U.S. Senator, with $13,647,676 as the most money funded from the NRA as of today. The politician with the second highest funding from the NRA is Richard Burr, a Senator from North Carolina, and he has accepted $6,987,380. The following politicians are Roy Blunt, Thom Tills, and Marco Rubio, in that order. This shows that despite popular opinion being to have stricter gun laws, politicians are supporting pro-gun laws and loosening restrictions to please the organizations they are receiving funding from. This can very easily be seen as bribery and bias controlling the very lives of U.S. citizens. Politicians should follow the will of the people they are supposed to be protecting because these people are their citizens and it is a politician's job. But instead, we are left with politicians that are passing laws that protect the organizations funding them.</p>

        <p>Gun control laws should not be based on the political party in office at the time. Guns are a danger to all people no matter their beliefs and lives should hold priority over political parties. Historically as well as currently, it has been found that the Republican party has supported and been supported by pro-gun laws and organizations. In fact, all five of the previously mentioned politicians being funded by the NRA identify as Republicans. This correlation means that with the changing presidents and political candidates, gun laws could become inconsistent. This could be dangerous because it leaves everyone unaware of what laws are in the country, it would create even more political disputes, and gun violence would likely spike and dip inconsistently. If gun laws are mixed with political parties, it puts political bias and affiliation over the safety and logic of laws (see <a href="capstone3.html">Article 3</a> for more).  Especially and specifically in the U.S., political parties have caused a major division of the people, ruining any sense of community and safety one could hope to achieve. Many issues revolving around healthcare and public safety are currently being controlled by political parties (see <a href="capstone2">Article 2</a> for more) and dividing the country farther than it has been in a long time. If gun control laws are being controlled by political parties, this will put the safety of everyone in the country under control of opinions. Human lives should not be left up to opinion.</p>

        <p>This research was taken by the Pew Research Center regarding party affiliation and its connection to opinions on gun laws and policies. This evidence suggests that the majority of the Republican party, especially currently, is either content with or wants looser gun laws while the opposite is true for the Democratic party. According to this same data, when the statistics of both parties is combinated for a grand total, it is found that the majority has consistently wanted stricter gun laws. But if the party that is in office at the time dictates laws surrounding gun control, depending on the party, these laws and policies could change and be switched around incredibly inconsistently.</p>

        <p>The Constitution of the United States of America clearly states in the Second Amendment that “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” This means that a person has the right to keep, buy, and carry guns. Because of gun violence in the USA, the Constitution needs to be changed. The main reasoning for stricter gun laws or assault rifle bans not passing through congress is the Second Amendment itself, as it is a right given in the Constitution itself. But gun violence has been a large-looming problem in the US for a long time now which is proof enough that the Second Amendment is now doing more harm than good to the state of the US, meaning it should be expunged. There is an old phrase that goes “if it still works, there’s no need for a new one.” This phrase needs to be applied to the Constitution– not in the sense that the Constitution doesn’t need to be fixed, but in the sense that the Second Amendment no longer works for the country. During the time that the Second Amendment was written, America was still a new country and needed to protect against foreign invaders, specifically Britain. Then, it made sense and actually benefited the people to have this Amendment, actually providing protection. Now, the risk of the average person getting threatened by a foreign invader is much less significant. Guns are clearly being used more commonly for offensive purposes rather than defensive, ruining the safety of the US. The Constitution is in place to protect the rights of the people, but if certain rights protected by the Constitution are putting the majority of people in the US in danger, these rights should be taken away. Safety should come before the pride that is involved with keeping these rights around. Just because the Constitution has been around for all this time doesn’t mean that it is still functioning in the way that it was meant to. Times change, people change, conditions change. The legislation controlling our country should be more liable to change with all of it. (See <a href="capstone3.html">Article 3</a> for more on the Constitution)</p>

        <p>The sale of assault weapons contributes significantly to domestic violence, suicide rates, and disproportionately affects minorities. Evidence of this can be shown with the statistics of gun violence in these specific situations. Regarding domestic abuse, The Crime Report says, “UC Davis researchers found that the states where firearm purchases rose the most also showed the largest increases in firearm injuries from domestic violence.” The American Journal of Preventive Medicine has conducted research by combining and comparing state-level data that was related to gun laws and domestic violence rates. They found that states with looser gun laws have 64.6% higher rates of gun-related domestic violence than states with stricter gun laws. This data is referring to men and women combined. (See <a href="capstone2.html">Article 2</a> for more on violent crimes) Gun sale also contributes significantly to suicide rates, 52.8% of suicides in 2020 being a firearm suicide. According to Brady United, having a gun in the household leaves a person with three times the risk of death by suicide. There is also a correlation between gun violence incidents and race. Gun violence disproportionately affects Black men specifically, a survey taken by the Pew Research center in April of 2021 showing that 82 percent of Black Americans believe that gun violence is a large problem in their community. The type of gun violence also differs widely in the Black community when compared to the white community, 77% of white deaths by gun violence being suicide, while only 14% of Black deaths by gun violence are suicides while 82% are homicides according to Brookings. Gun violence also affects the LGBTQ+, the Sandy Hook Promise stating, “[...]nearly 20% of all hate crimes are motivated by sexual orientation and / or gender identity bias. Guns can make these crimes all the more deadly. In fact, nearly 8 in 10 homicides of Black trans women are by a gun.” LGBTQ+ bars and clubs are also regularly attacked with guns as a form of hate crime. Banning the sale of assault weapons would decrease these statistics and make the gaping difference between races in the US lessen.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, politicians follow the will of pro-gun organizations rather than the people, political party controlling gun laws is detrimental, the Constitution needs to be changed, and the sale of assault weapons contributes to suicide rates, domestic abuse, and disproportionately affects minority groups. Having stricter gun laws or even banning assault weapons will take monetary bribes out of our government, keep guns out of politics, increase the safety of everyone in the country, and reduce the rates of hate crimes and discrimination against minorities. Having gun laws that are stricter can only benefit the state of the US.</p>
