        <h3>Argument</h3>
        <p>Religion should not be so heavily incorporated in our laws and government, yet everywhere you look, you will find some sort of reference to God, especially the Christian or Catholic God that is dominantly believed in in the US. But just because these religions are dominant does not mean that the rest of the population that does not devote to them doesn't deserve representation in our government.</p>
        <p>According to the census of 2020, 70% of the population identifies as Christian or Catholic, leaving 30% of the population believing in another religion or no religion at all. God is mentioned everywhere in our law and government, the Pledge of Allegiance saying the phrase, “One nation, under God…”, along with many other state Constitutions mentioning God. The original Constitution doesn’t directly mention God, but references some sort of “higher being.” Research conducted by the Pew Research Center has allowed for them to write that, “God or the divine is mentioned at least once in each of the 50 state constitutions and nearly 200 times overall[...]”, and, “In addition to the 116 mentions of God, there are also 14 mentions of a Supreme or Sovereign Being, seven mentions of the ‘Creator,’ three mentions of ‘providence,’ four mentions of ‘divine’ and 46 instances of the word ‘almighty.’ While there are 32 mentions of the word ‘Lord,’ all but one refer to ‘the year of our Lord’ and so are not direct references to God. (Indeed, the U.S. Constitution also makes reference to ‘the year of our Lord.’) There also are seven mentions of the word ‘Christian.’” Having God frequently brought up in the Constitution and law system leads one to believe that Christian or Catholic morals are being incorporated with our laws that– especially as of recently– are affecting a person’s bodily rights (see <a href="capstone2.html">Article 2</a>).</p>
        <p>This inference also leads one to be under the impression that certain beliefs and morals are being enforced upon the entire country that are in line with certain religions that not everyone follows. Freedom of Religion is a right protected by the First Amendment, and the lack of Separation of Church and State is reason for one to decide that their rights have been violated. America is a diverse country, and yet when it comes to religion, there is no acknowledgment of any religion that differs from the beliefs of Christianity or Catholicism. There have been arguments that having God in the law system provides a sense of discipline, but again, that only works for those who believe in God. Swearing on a bible in court won’t push anyone who doesn’t devote themselves to religion or even just a religion that believes in that specific God to be more truthful, making the effort a complete waste.</p>
        <p>It’s true that the reason we do or have things this way is because times were very different back when the Constitutions were written, but that’s exactly the point. Back when these pieces of legislation were being written, the country was not nearly as diverse as it is today, and even then, the views on the world were much different and more conservative. As we move into a new age where people of all kinds are being recognized, our law system needs to move with us (See <a href="index.html">Article 1</a> for more on the Constitution and outdated legislation). In an article on Separation of Church and State published by Cornell University states, “Separation of Church and State is a phrase that refers to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The phrase dates back to the early days of U.S. history, and Thomas Jefferson referred to the First Amendment as creating a ‘wall of separation’ between church and state as the third president of the U.S. The term is also often employed in court cases.” If this is true, it only goes on to prove that the First Amendment right of Freedom of Religion is being violated with the utter lack of separation between religion and law and government.</p>
