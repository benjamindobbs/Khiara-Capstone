        <h3>Argument</h3>
        <p>In 1973, the Supreme Court established a bill, Roe vs. Wade, protecting a person’s right to abortion. Summer of 2022, the Supreme Court overturned this bill and left the legality of abortions up to the individual states. As of right now in the US, 13 states have strict abortion bans, 11 states have hostile laws that are against abortion, but abortions are not necessarily illegal up until a certain point, 4 states including Puerto Rico have no laws protecting abortions, but no laws necessarily against them either, 12 states have laws in place protecting abortions, and the remaining states or territories (11) have expanded access to abortion available.</p>
        <p>Taking a person’s right to abortion away is dangerous and immoral for several reasons. An argument is that if a person does not want to get pregnant, they just need to not have sex. Shaming a person for their sex life brings up an entirely different argument that we will not discuss right now, but consensual sex is not the only cause of pregnancy. Pregnancies from rape or incest are a real problem for anyone with a uterus and banning abortions would force victims to birth the child they did not want, a child that could have a disability or genetic mutation (from incest specifically) that the state and society will fail to properly support, or a person could be at risk of not even surviving birth. According to the CDC, nearly 3 million women in the US have experienced rape-related pregnancy in their lifetime, a staggering statistic. And these are only reported incidents. The CDC goes on to report that, “Of women who were raped by an intimate partner, 30% experienced a form of reproductive coercion by the same partner. Specifically, about 20% reported that their partner had tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control. About 23% reported their partner refused to use a condom[...]” Again, these statistics are only taken from reported incidents, meaning there are even more incidents and rape-related pregnancies that are not being taken into account. Since the person giving birth to the child is the one having to care for, carry, and birth the child, it should be their choice whether or not they want a child.</p>
        <p>A recent incident that goes to show how problematic abortion bans are is a 10 year old in Ohio. She was raped by an adult male and became pregnant with his child, but since she filed for an abortion 3 days after the 6 week ban Ohio had in place, she was refused an abortion despite the knowledge that she was pregnant due to rape, and that she would not likely survive giving birth. This forced her to have to travel to another state to get that abortion, the doctor that provided her that abortion being arrested. A common argument that goes against abortion is that abortion is murder since you’re killing the fetus, but this situation shows that it’s not about saving the children since a child that was already born and had suffered a tragedy and was refused a life-saving procedure because she missed the set deadline by 3 days.</p>
        <p>Another factor to consider when forcing a person to give birth is the cost of birthing and raising a child. Children are expensive to care for, and hospital bills are not cheap either. Hospitals charge an average of  $22,876 for birthing procedures. That alone could be more than a person’s yearly salary, especially if the person works a minimum wage job. To raise a child was estimated to cost around $202,020 for a married couple, but has now increased to be $233,610 due to inflation. A lot of people today are living paycheck to paycheck, and even financial aid from the government could fail to give a person the resources, time, and money needed to raise a child. Forcing a person to give birth could leave their child with an unhappy life, with possibilities of needing to be put into foster care, being underprovided for, or possibly neglected. Forcing a person to have a child that they do not want ruins the bond between parent and child and makes the child more of a burden rather than a responsibility purposefully taken on.</p>
        <p>To conclude, a person should have the right to decide whether or not they get an abortion for themselves because of financial factors, mutation possibilities, danger to the birthing person, and rape-related pregnancy. These are only a few reasons as to why abortion needs to be accessible to everyone who might need one, but they are strong arguments that truly question the reasoning behind abortion bans. Banning abortion kills more people than it would save.</p>
